                    Swiss Cottage Tioman is a family and dive resort situated west of Tekek village on a peaceful beachside, featuring a very relaxing jungle-like garden setting and cosy chalets. 
                    Despite its name, the resort is very Balinese in architecture, with ethnic stylings and plenty of tribal decorations. 
                    The hotel operates a dive center and the only freediving school in Tioman.
                    All chalet and terrace room units come equipped with air-conditioning, attached bathroom with hot water shower and private balcony. 
                    The sea view beachfront bungalows have the same amenities but are larger in space and fan-cooled. Facilities include a small restaurant serving Western fusion meals and reading lounge at lobby.
                     Round-island tour trips by speedboat may be organised upon request

                    Panuba Inn is a beach resort nestled with a secluded bay west of Air Batang, accessible by ferry, speedboat or a relatively short jungle trail from the village. 
                    This beautiful landscape is the hotel's focal attraction,
                    with a stunning landscape of boulders and rocks that hide numerous coral reefs and colourful fishes beneath a crystal clear blue sea.
                    Almost the entire resort lies stretched across a steep hill that feeds into the bay, while villas and chalets tower almost precariously on stilts. 
                    The resort has an abundance of accommodation, ranging from basic fan rooms to more opulent units, each with a private balcony that opens out to a fantastic view of the island and sea.
